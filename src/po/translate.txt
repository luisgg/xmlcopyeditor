=== How To Make Translation Files of XML-Copy-Editor ===

1. Translate
1) For Linux users
That's quite easy. Download Xml-copy-editor(called XCE below :P),
unpack it. Go to that source dirctory. Here you can see many ".cpp" 
files and ".h" files. input command:

$ xgettext -k_ -kwxPLURAL:1,2 --from-code=utf-8  *.cpp *.h

then you get a "messages.po" in the dirctory. That's the ".po" file we 
need to translate. You need a tool to help you finish the translation 
job. I recommend poedit, a fast and light-weight translation tool.
You can get it from http://www.poedit.net/ or http://poedit.sf.net/ .
They are the same. Install it then use to open the ".po" file, 

There're a few things need to be filled into the poedit. Run poedit, 
select "File"-"Preferences", fill in your name and email address blanks.
Back to main window, select "Catalog"-"Settings", fill the items like 
below:

"Project name and version:" -> "XML Copy Editor (your source version)"
"Team:" -> "(your translation team)"
"Team's email address:" -> "(your team's email address)"
"Language:" -> "(your native language)"
"Country:" -> "(your country)"
"Charset:" -> "(charset you currently using. utf-8 would be better)"
"Source code and charset:" -> "utf-8"
"Plurals Forms:" -> "nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1)"

OK! Now go to the main window and the rest thing is ... translate them
all! :P

When you've finished translating the ".po" file, you can use:

$ msgfmt messages.po

to get the ".mo" file. Semd the ".po" and ".mo" files to XCE's authors 
email box.

2) For Windows users
Like in Linux, we should get XCE's source code and poedit windows 
version. Uncompress the source and install poedit in "c:\poedit", then 
open a "Command Window" by executing "cmd.exe". Go to the XCE's source 
directory, run:

c:\poedit\bin\xgettext.exe -k_ -kwxPLURAL:1,2 --from-code=utf-8  *.cpp *.h

to a messages.po file. Setup poedit the same as in the Linux part, then 
open the ".po" file you just created and translate all items. When you 
close poedit, a "messages.mo" will be made automatically.


2. Update translation
1) For Linux users
Create a new version of "messages.po" file and rename it to "msg-new.po".
Copy the old version ".po" file to the same directory and rename it to 
"msg-old.po", then run:

$ msgmerge msg-old.po msg-new.po >output.po

the "output.po" file is the new version of ".po" file with old 
translations added. Then translate the "output.po" file.

2) For Windows users
Do the first part as Linux users, then run:

c:\poedit\bin\msgmerge.exe msg-old.po msg-new.po > output.po

translate the "output.po" file.
