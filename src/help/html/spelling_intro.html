    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The aim has been to create a spelling and style check that is more user-friendly and flexible but no less reliable than the ones provided by standard office applications.</p>
    <p>To start, select ‘Spelling and Style’ from the Tools menu or press F7. At the top of the Spelling and Style Dialog, you can select a rule set (e.g. Default dictionary or Diversity) and filter (e.g. XHTML or WordprocessingML). Press ‘Report’ to check the document.</p>
    <p>Once the table of matches and suggestions has been filled, you can tweak the report (e.g. mark some matches as ‘Ignore’, others as ‘Change’) before making the selected changes by pressing ‘Edit’.</p>
    <p>Double-clicking items toggles the item status between ‘Change’ and ‘Ignore’. Right-clicking the item allows you to change the status of groups of matches or enter a new suggestion.</p>
    <p>The ‘Web report’ and ‘Web summary’ options are intended for users who wish to check the matches in a browser or on paper. Only items marked ‘Change’ are listed here. To set all items to ‘Ignore’ or ‘Change’ in one step, select ‘Change all’ or ‘Ignore all’.</p>
    <p>The spelling and style check is parser-based, not least in order to enable the user to exclude the contents of specific elements (e.g. binData elements in namespace http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2003/wordml). As a result, documents that are not well-formed are checked in read-only mode.</p>
