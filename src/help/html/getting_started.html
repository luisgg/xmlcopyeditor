    <h1>Getting started</h1>
    <p>The best way to get started is to select New or Open from the File menu. The editor offers a range of facilities including syntax highlighting, folding and tag completion.</p>
    <p>The File and Edit menus (and shortcuts) will be familiar to users of office programs. The View menu allows the user to switch between documents, open documents in the browser, choose a different color scheme or adjust the font size. All XML tools are accessible via the XML menu and function keys. The Tools menu contains the Spelling and Style and Options dialogs.</p>
    <p>The main design goal has been to avoid non-essential windows and toolbars. The toolbar contains only a handful of icons and can be hidden if it is not needed. The documents are shown as tabs in a single notebook (as in Firefox, you can close tabs using the middle mouse button).</p>
    <p>Message boxes are only used if a user response is required. For all other communications, a message pane opens above the status bar. (You can close this pane by clicking on the ‘x’ symbol or pressing Escape.)</p>
