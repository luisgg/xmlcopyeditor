    <h1>Folding</h1>
    <p>Folding is available both for XML elements and for embedded scripts (e.g. PHP).</p>
    <p>If you are working with large documents, you may find that folding is fairly processor-intensive. You can achieve significant performance gains by disabling this option in the Editor tab of the Options dialog.</p>
